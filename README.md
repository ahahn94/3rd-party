Third Party Apps (DEPRECATED)
=============================

**Note**: This repo will not accept NEW packages as we are replacing the majority of them in Solus with a modern solution like flatpak. After we have flatpak integrated in the Software Center we will begin forceful deprecation of this repository.

This repo contains the build files required to create packages that cannot be redistributed, whether for licensing restrictions or otherwise.

For more information about 3rd party applications in Solus, visit our Help Center page at https://getsol.us/articles/software/third-party/en/.


DO NOT PUSH BINARY PACKAGES. The git history has been reset because it ballooned to nearly 300MB in size. :)
